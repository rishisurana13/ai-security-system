# Jarvis Mark I

This is the first iteration in a series of Neural Networks to come. The goal is to have a single NLP endpoint to interpret natural language and convert them to a set of instructions for other endpoints in other Neural Networks, personal devices and IoT devices, like this security system. This is very similar to alexa and google home, only, its reach will extend outside of your home and will interact with network of other personal assistant AI's. It comes with the caveat of making the entire system extremely user friendly to reach a level of optimal usage and an edge over competitors. 

That said, here is the first iteration of JARVIS. A modern day AI-based security system for your business or home. 

## Instructions

1. In your terminal, navigate to the root of the project file. 
2. Run ```source jarvis-ide/bin/activate``` followed by ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
3. Open another tab of the same directory in the terminal.
4. In one tab run ```python3 detect.py``` and ```python3 stream.py``` in the other.
5. Open ``` http://0.0.0.0:5000/``` in your browser to watch the stream.
